# Outdoor Event Log


For our LiftOff project we decided to create an outdoors activity log. Users will be able to create accounts, add outdoor events by category, upload pictures to the event, and add a tag using GoogleMaps.


Features: 1. User login<br>
          2. Users can create, read, edit, and delete events
          3. Users search 
          4. Automatically tags location data for posts
          5. Rate locations

Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, Thymeleaf templates, Google API
